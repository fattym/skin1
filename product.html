                <p>Dry skin can be uncorfortable and unattractive. It often shows up as rough, red and itchy patches in places that show--arms, hands, lower legs, ankles. But it's also common on soles of the feet, thighs and the abdomen. No matter what the cause, there are many things you can do to make dry skin smooth and supple.</p>

                <p>‘Normal’ is a term widely used to refer to well-balanced skin. The scientific term for well-balanced skin is eudermic. The T-zone (forehead, chin and nose) may be a bit oily, but overall sebum and moisture is balanced and the skin is neither too oily nor too dry.</p>

                <h3 class="card-title">OILY SKIN</h3>
                <p>Oily skin is the result of overproduction of sebum from sebaceous glands. These glands are located under the skin's surface. Too much sebum, however, may lead to oily skin, which can lead to clogged pores and acne.</p>
